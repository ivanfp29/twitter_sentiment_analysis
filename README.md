# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Twitter sentiment analysis using Python utilising NLP (Natural Language Processing)

The objective of this project is to be my first entry into proper NLP development, beyond theory and research conducted in previous employment. 


Follow on projects will include: 
- Image classification AI using Computer Vision
- Handwriting recognition AI with TensorFlow library.

I'll aim to document in a comprehensive, clear fashion such that my project is repeatable for others.
